YouTube counts views based on the number of times a video has been played. A view is counted when a viewer initiates the playback of a video or watches an embedded video for at least 30 seconds   . If the video is less than 30 seconds in length, then the entire duration of the clip will be counted as a view . YouTube uses various metrics to track and filter out fraudulent or fake views such as bots and spamming .
YouTube engagement metrics (views, likes, dislikes, and subscriptions) reflect how many times your YouTube video or channel has been interacted with. These metrics can be an important measure of your video or channelâ€™s overall popularity. YouTube wants to make sure that your metrics are high quality and come from actual humans and not computer programs. It takes their systems some time to figure out which views, likes, dislikes, and subscriptions are legitimate. After legitimate engagement events are counted, your metric count should update more often. The timing of these changes varies depending on a video or channel's popularity and views. Keep in mind that YouTube is constantly confirming and adjusting engagement events. On some videos and channels, your metric count might seem frozen or not show the metrics that you expect. Metrics are algorithmically confirmed to maintain fair and positive experiences for content creators, advertisers, and viewers .
I hope this helps!
